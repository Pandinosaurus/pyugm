Maybe concentrate on getting a discrete bayesian network going first.
Factor out the update ordering.
Add gaussian priors [rather dirichlet priors?] - variable and conditional. (Variational/expectation update?)
Add plates - update order should take this into account.
Plates for dynamic models.
Clusters?

Looks like I'm rather going with un-normalised models first.
Gaussian prior.
Factors should now be parametrised - add place where parameter variables can be added to a factor.
Use BFGS to find MAP
Then approximate posterior with Laplace approximation using Hessian returned by BFGS.

Running into numerical problems - time to factor out the normalising constant.
This will complicate testing - for now replace existing data tests with data * constant.
For new tests use accessor methods.
Wondering about architecture - should only inplace updates be allowed?

Example HMM.
