Maybe concentrate on getting a discrete bayesian network going first.
Factor out the update ordering.
Add gaussian priors [rather dirichlet priors?] - variable and conditional. (Variational/expectation update?)
Add plates - update order should take this into account.
Plates for dynamic models.
Clusters?

Looks like I'm rather going with un-normalised models first.
Gaussian prior.
Factors should now be parametrised - add place where parameter variables can be added to a factor.
Use BFGS to find MAP
Then approximate posterior with Laplace approximation using Hessian returned by BFGS.

Running into numerical problems - time to factor out the normalising constant.
This will complicate testing - for now replace existing data tests with data * constant.
For new tests use accessor methods.
Wondering about architecture - should only inplace updates be allowed?

Example HMM.

## 27 September 2014
Optimise for speed. - Numba looks like it is working. Add Numba update function.
Flooding protocol is slow - build distribute/collect protocol for trees.

## 11 October 2014
Document as clique templates (from Sutton and McCallum's tutorial)

## 20 October 2014
Report approximate ll, evidence each iteration.
Learn with approximate gradient for first few iterations.
Do whole update function with numba.
Does distribute/collect work with non-trees?
