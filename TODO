Maybe concentrate on getting a discrete bayesian network going first.
Factor out the update ordering.
Add gaussian priors [rather dirichlet priors?] - variable and conditional. (Variational/expectation update?)
Add plates - update order should take this into account.
Plates for dynamic models.
Clusters?
